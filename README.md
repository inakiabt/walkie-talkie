# Walkie-Talkie [Adapted for Parse Cloud Code]
### An interface for speaking to intercom.io API.

Walkie-Talkie is a fork of the original project [node-intercom](https://github.com/silentrob/node-intercom) developed by [Rob Ellis](https://github.com/silentrob).
I used the original project as a basis to further develop my nodeJS skills and contribute back to the Open Source community. We also use Walkie-Talkie internally for [Postach.io](http://postach.io) for recording events and user conversation management.


## Installation

To start playing with the library in your project, run

    npm install walkie-talkie --save


## API Overview

To implement Walkie-Talkie, this is the basic method to get data for a user by email

    var settings = {
      "api_key": "your_API_key",
      "app_id": "your_APP_ID"
    }

    var intercom = require('walkie-talkie').app(settings);

    intercom.users.get('test@example.com', function(code, body) {
        // code is the request status code from the API
        // body is the response body as a JSON object
        console.log(code);
        console.log(body);
    });

See the tests folder for more examples on usage. The Intercom.io complete docs can be found here - http://doc.intercom.io/api/


## Contributing and Testing

Contributing bug fixes and features is very welcome! If you want to contribute to the project, you'll need to create and run tests for anything you add that needs it.

Mocha is used for testing so add your tests to the `test` folder, but first you'll need to create a `config.json` file in the root of the tests folder and fill it with your credentials.

Start by installing the project dependencies by running

    npm install && npm install -g mocha gulp

then create your `config.json` in the `test` folder.

    {
      "settings": {
        "app_id": "APP_ID_HERE",
        "api_key": "API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }

Now you can finally run the tests.

    gulp test
